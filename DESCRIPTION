Description: Searching for academic information in bibliographic 
    databases often needs to be reported accurately and comprensively, 
    for example when conducting a systematic review. Reporting search 
    histories is challenging, however, since no standardised file 
    format has previously been established to ensure sufficient 
    information is reporting in the correct way to allow for 
    evaluation and replication of searches. This package allows users 
    to embed a standardised search history file within a traditional 
    RIS reference file, recording how the references within were 
    obtained. Functions allow search history files (stored as JSONs) 
    to be embedded within and extracted from RIS files. The resultant 
    RIS files can be read as normal in other reference management tools, 
    but contain an entire search history within their first record.
